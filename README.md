Here, talk about what the project is. I know the name of the game is pretty self-explanatory, but just include a sentence or two.

## Why I'm Proud of this Project

â€‹
This was my first-ever project that involved using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Before this, I had only ever dabbled with HTML and CSS. If HTML was my introduction to development, then when I was introduced to JavaScript it was the equivalent to me being thrown into the deep end of a pool. It was a difficult to learn the language at first, but now has become a reliable force that I can rely on. Since becoming proficient with JavaScript, I have enjoyed using vanilla JavaScript in projects like this one or in frameworks such as React or Node.
