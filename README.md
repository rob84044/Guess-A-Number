Here, talk about what the project is. I know the name of the game is pretty self-explanatory, but just include a sentence or two.

## Background

â€‹
This project utilizes vanilla javascript and DOM manipulation to allow a user to play a number guessing game. The UI utilizes the Skeleton CSS framework. I use Netlify for a CI/CD provider.

## Why I'm Proud of this Project

â€‹
This was my very first project that ever involved javascript and DOM manipulation. Before this I just dabbled with HTML and CSS. If HTML was my introduction to development, when I was introduced to javascript it was equivalent to me being thrown into the deep end of a pool. It was a difficult to learn language at first, but now has become a reliable force that I can rely on. I have enjoyed learning javascript to implement it `vanilla` in projects such as these or in frameworks such as React or Node.
